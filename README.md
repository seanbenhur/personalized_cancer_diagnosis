# Personalized Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning
## Objective
>  The objective of the project is to create a Machine Learning model which classifies the mutations of the gene classes automatically that helps in personal diagnosis for cancer patients
## Data
> The dataset consists of<li>Gene</li><li>Variation of the amino acid</li><li>Text(the clinical evidence used to classify the genetic mutation)</li> The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data)
